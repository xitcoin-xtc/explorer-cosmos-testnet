# Xitcoin Cosmos Testnet Explorer (superseded)

This repository contains the earlier standalone Cosmos explorer source. It is
retained for source history and is not the canonical deployment source.

The active public explorer is maintained in
[`xitcoin-org/explorer-testnet`](https://github.com/xitcoin-org/explorer-testnet).
Do not deploy this repository against the retired `xitcoin-testnet-1` network.

## Active network

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Network | Xitcoin Public Testnet |
| Cosmos chain ID | `xitcoin-testnet-v2-1` |
| Address prefix | `xtc` |
| Validator prefix | `xtcvaloper` |
| Native currency | XTC |
| Public explorer | https://explorer-testnet.xitchain.com/ |

The retired `xitcoin-testnet-1` files exist only for historical verification.
Canonical network files are maintained in
[`xitcoin-org/testnets`](https://github.com/xitcoin-org/testnets), and node
software is maintained in
[`xitcoin-org/pos-chain`](https://github.com/xitcoin-org/pos-chain).

## Historical development

Requirements: Node.js and Yarn.

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
